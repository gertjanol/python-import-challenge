=======================

Make the test in main.py work without changing the contents of ```badmodule.py```. ```main.py``` and ```moduleuser.py``` may be altered, as long as the assertion is kept as is, and as long as the actual return value of ```MyModule.banaan()``` is tested :).

```
python main.py
```
